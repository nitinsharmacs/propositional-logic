#+TITLE: Propositional Logic With e-lisp
* Knowledge Base
The knowledge base is an plug-able application, where every newly added rule plugs in additional functions into the existing knowledge base. The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity][homoiconic]] nature of elisp is exploited to achieve this.

So for this exploration we would be looking at the implementation of =Modus Ponens= and =Modus Tollens= using the idea of function-data supper position.
** Using the knowledge base
Setting the rule
_Rule 1_

=(rule a 'implies b)=

/Observation/
=(~b)= -> =~a=
=(b)= -> undefined


_Rule 2_
=(rule a 'implies ~b)=

/Observation/
=(~b)= -> undefined
=(b)= -> =~a=


_Rule 3_
=(rule ~a 'implies ~b)=

/Observation/
=(~b)= -> undefined
=(b)= -> =a=


_Rule 4_
=(rule ~a 'implies b)=

/Observation/
=(~b)= -> =a=
=(b)= -> undefined
